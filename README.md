## Welcome to Throw !t Away

We started from the statement, that the streets of Paris are full of butts, which is not surprising when you know that 60% of the 50 billion cigarettes sold each year in France, are finishing in our environment. Knowing that, one butt can take up to 12 years to degrade and can pollute 500 liters of water. At first glance, the act of throwing away a butt seems inconsequential, but it is a major environmental issue.

### Problem

By choosing this problem, we wanted to understand why smokers prefer throwing their cigarettes on the floor, instead of throwing it in a rubbish, even if they are likely to pay a fine of 68 €. 
We have chosen to focus ourselves on Sciences Po Paris’s students, from 13th Université street to 9th La Chaise street. The reason a smoker throws its cigarette on the floor, is mainly because there is no rubbish close to him/her and he/she doesn’t have time to search for one. Our goal is to reduce by 20% the number of butts in the streets. To have an idea of the amount, we picked up all butts we have seen in front of the 27 Saint Guillaume street entrance. As a result, we collected more than … butts, which means we hope to collect not more than … the same day at the same time...

### Proposed concept 

THROW !T WELL (T!W), is a game app that a smoker could download on his/her smartphone. The user could notify when he/she buys a new cigarette pack by scanning the bar code, which automatically fill a gauge with 20 cigarettes. 
On this app, it is possible to locate trashes close to you with the exact number of steps you need to do to attend it. During your walk, you are geolocated and thus when you are close enough to a rubbish, you are able to notify that you have thrown your butt.

At this point, a wheel appears and turns to randomly choose one of these 5 categories:
-Environmental fact
-General fun fact
-Joke
-Reduction of 1€ maximum at a partner 
-Encouragement phrase

Firstly, T!W will be test on Sciences Po’s students during 2 weeks. If the results are convincing, it will be easy to extent T!W to the rest of the smoker population.
