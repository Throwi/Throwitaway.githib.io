## Welcome to Throw !t Away

We started from the statement, that the streets of Paris are full of butts, which is not surprising when you know that **60% of the 50 billion cigarettes sold each year in France, are finishing in our environment.** Knowing that, one butt can take up to 12 years to degrade and can pollute 500 liters of water. At first glance, the act of throwing away a butt seems inconsequential, but it is a major environmental issue.

### Problem

By choosing this problem, **we wanted to understand why smokers
prefer throwing their cigarettes on the floor, instead of throwing it in a
rubbish, even if they are likely to pay a fine of 68 €.**
We have chosen to focus ourselves on Sciences Po Paris’s students,
from _13 th Université street_ to _9 th La Chaise street_. We discovered that
when a smoker throws its cigarette on the floor, it is mainly because
there is no rubbish close to him/her and he/she doesn’t have time to
search for one. Our goal is to reduce by 20% the number of butts in the
streets. To have an idea of the amount, we picked up all butts we have
seen in front of the 27 Saint Guillaume street entrance. As a result, we
collected more than 300 butts, which means we hope to collect not
more than 240 the same day at the same time _(Thursday, between 1:00
pm and 2:00 pm)._
### Proposed concept 

THROW !T WELL (T!W), is a game app that a smoker could download on
his/her smartphone. The user could notify when he/she buys a new
cigarette pack by scanning the bar code, which automatically fill a gauge
with 20 cigarettes.
On this app, it is possible to locate trashes close to you with the exact
number of steps you need to do to attend it. During your walk, you are
geolocated and thus when you are close enough to a rubbish, you are
able to notify that you have thrown your butt.
At this point, a wheel appears and turns to randomly choose one of
these 5 categories:
_-Environmental fact
-General fun fact
-Joke
-Reduction of 1€ maximum at a partner
-Encouragement phrase_
Firstly, T!W will be test on Sciences Po’s students during 2 weeks. If the
results are convincing, it will be easy to extent T!W to the rest of the
smoker population.

### What we expect 


**Firstly**, we expect that smokers will feel more concerned by the
environmental impact caused by throwing a butt on the floor. To value
the person that throw its butt in the trash, we will include
encouragement phrase such as:
_“Thanks for your action, you are protecting the environment”
“By throwing this butt in the rubbish, you save turtle babies”_

**Secondly**, we hope that people will influence each other in the good
way, especially thanks to the collective action we want to develop in
T!W.

**Thirdly**, the more butts are thrown in this trash, the more streets will
stay clean. This axis is part of our communication plan.

Our goal is not to incite people to smoke in order to play, that’s why we
have chosen to reward financially this action at 1€ maximum. One pack
cost 7 €, so in one month a smoker will not earn more than 2 € with the
wheel.

### Major risks and action to reduce them

The major risk is that the user will be bored, may not durably change
students’ behaviours outside of the Sciences Po’s zone. Communication
and sensitization around the environmental benefits of a well thrown
butt is really important. That’s why we decided to produce a teaser to
present our project. This short film will be published on social medias
such as Facebook _(2,2 billion users in 2018)_ and Twitter to make it go
viral, in order to promote our activities and partners.
Another risk is that this game app will only function on the public road.
In the private sphere, people will smoke and throw their butt in their
rubbish. To prevent this risk, people will be able to add their rubbish on
the open source map. 

### Return on investments analysis

To begin with, we want to create a game app, which means we need to
hire an app developer. This kind of service costs between 3000 € and
5000 €. In our case, we want to integrate a map which maintenance of
located trashes will be ensuring by everybody in open source.
Nevertheless, someone will have to check and update this app. 
That’s why we want to hire a self-entrepreneur with digital skills, negotiation
knowledge and a short community management experience. 
Thisperson could be a student paid at the minimum wage, that is to say 9,8
€/hour in France, and work 10 hours a week.

Total first year: _4000 € + (9,88 € * 10 * (52-8)) = 8347 €_

Total other years: _5137 €_

To finance our project the first year, we are going to apply for grants
from local partners and private people such as:

- Sciences Po for our association = _1000 €_
- Cleanliness service of the city = _5000 €_
- Businesses working for sustainable development = _1000 €_ We want to develop partnerships with those businesses to obtain reductions for our clients, entirely paid by the partner.
- Crowdfunding = _1500 €_
